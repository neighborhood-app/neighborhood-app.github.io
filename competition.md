Our competitors try to enhance the community aspect of neighborhoods by creating a news feed for specific areas. We, on the other hand want to focus on simplicity and encourage face-to-face interactions.

Most of them are only available within certain areas of the globe (ex. USA) and are focused on creating a news feed with local events and posts. While our objectives are the same, our philosophies are completely different. _Neighbourhood_ is focused on simplicity and encouraging interaction outside the app, in the real-world. We intentionally left out features such as friend-requests, news feeds and other elements that we see as a distraction from our main objective of encouraging cooperation between neighbours.

Our content is curated by the administrator of each 'Neighbourhood', which also acts as a gatekeeper, deciding who can actually join or not. Having this filter, in the form of the neighbourhood admin ensures that the communities being formed will be made up of people that actually have the ability to help each other.
