## The MVP

Knowing the full extent of features necessary to build a complete social-media app for local communities, the team at _Neighbourhood_ decided to focus its time and resources on a limited set of functionalities that have the highest ROI. In the of our app, it is facilitating the process of asking for and receiving help. We are aware that it is not enough for a fully fledged social-media platform, but it is enough to validate our ideea. 

With this MVP we've created the foundation on top of which we can add more features and perfect what we already have. We are confident that the processes we've set up and the technical decisions we've made up until this point will allow us to continue development in a streamlined and efficient way.

## Future plans

### In-app chat system

In this MVP, due to time and resource limitations, communication between users is facilitated by exposing a user's email to the user that requested help. This is not ideal and we would like to implement an in-app chat system that allows users to interact directly within the app, without having to use an external service.

### Administration tools

In the future we want _Neighbourhood_ to become a platform that allows for the complete administration of a local community. This means that we want to give Neighbourhood admins the power to be able to post announcements and to allow users to take a more active role in how their community is being managed.

In the case of _Neighbourhoods_ that represent administrative entities, such as residential areas, we want to add the option for users to be able to pay their maintenance fees (and others) directly via the app. We also want to implement a dashboard for each neighborhood that shows useful information, such as maintenance costs, repair costs etc.

### Native mobile version

In its current state, _Neighbourhood_ is completely responsive on mobile phones and tablets, however, responsiveness isn't everything and we would like to leverage the possibiliies that a native app offers to its users. At the moment we are still debating between going completely native or build a PWA. 

### Enhancements

- Allow users to completely customize their profile, including their profile picture;
- Allow users to change their neighborhoods photo;
- Achieve greater frontend test coverage and write end-to-end tests;
