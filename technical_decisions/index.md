Every project requires a set of technical decisions to be made. Such decisions need to be made after carefully weighing the pros and cons of the available options since they'll have a profound impact on the workflow of the team, introduce or lift limitations and will also impact the performance of the end result.
The team at `Neighbourhood` strived to make the best decisions given the specific requirements of the project.
