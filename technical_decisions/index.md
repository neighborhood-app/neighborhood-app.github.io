Every project requires a set of technical decisions to be made. Such decisions need to be made after carefully weighing the pros and cons of multiple options due to the fact that they can can have a profound impact on the workflow of the team, the limitations that need to be imposed and also the performance of the end result.
The team at `Neighbourhood` strived to make the best decisions given the specific requirements of the project.
